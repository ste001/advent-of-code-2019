# Advent of Code 2019

This repo contains my solutions of AoC 2019. If you want to know more about this set of challenges/competition, check out [this link.](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about)

Python is the language I decided to go with this year, so you'll need to have it installed in your system if you want to run these solutions.

## Usage

In every day, there's a `sol.py` file. Run it as:
``` python
python3 sol.py
```
to see the solution to Part 1 and Part 2 of that day.
